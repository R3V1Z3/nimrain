# NimRain
Rain in your terminal, an experiment made with [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/).

Features:
- No external dependencies, only core Nim modules used.
- Adjusts to window size changes by setting the size each iteration of the main loop.

## Why?

I'm building a more complex project for which this code should serve as the background; a dark, rainy backdrop.

## Why Nim?

I actually intended to use and even started with Rust. But I couldn't seem to get Rust working properly in WSL on my Windows laptop. So I tried Nim and it worked. On top of that, Nim was so easy to grasp and read that I felt ecstatic about the choice.
